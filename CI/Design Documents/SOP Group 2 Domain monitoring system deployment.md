# SOP: Group 2 - Domain monitoring system
# deployment with AWS and Jenkins

## 1. Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) outlines the step-by-step process to set up a Jenkins CI/CD
system using two AWS EC2 instances (t3.micro, Ubuntu 24.04 LTS) with Docker. We will configure one
instance as the **Jenkins Master** (controller) and another as the **Jenkins Agent** (worker). The Jenkins
Master will orchestrate the pipeline (listening for GitHub webhooks and triggering jobs), while the
Jenkins Agent will perform the build, test, and deployment steps in Docker containers. By following this
guide, even users with minimal background knowledge will be able to launch the infrastructure, install
required software, configure Jenkins, set up a pipeline triggered by GitHub pushes, and handle all
necessary networking and persistence configurations.

## 2. System Architecture

```
Jenkins Master (Controller): Runs in a Docker container on the first EC2 instance. It hosts the
Jenkins web UI, receives GitHub webhook notifications, and coordinates pipeline execution. The
master triggers build/test jobs on the agent node and aggregates results. It listens on port 8080
for the web UI and webhook endpoint, and on port 50000 for inbound agent connections (JNLP).
Jenkins Agent (Worker): Runs in a Docker container on the second EC2 instance. The agent
connects to the master and executes the pipeline tasks (building Docker images, running the
application's test suite, etc.) as instructed by the master. In this setup, the agent will use Docker
to build and run the Domain Monitoring System application for testing. The application under
test may be exposed on port 8081 (for example, for web UI tests), and the agent uses port 50000
to communicate with the master.
```
Both instances are in the same AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) and will communicate over the private
network for Jenkins traffic. The diagram below illustrates the high-level architecture:

```
GitHub Repo: Hosts the source code and a Jenkinsfile defining the pipeline. A webhook on
the repo will notify Jenkins of new commits.
AWS EC2 Jenkins Master: Docker container running Jenkins (exposed on port 8080). Receives
webhook, triggers pipeline.
AWS EC2 Jenkins Agent: Docker container running Jenkins agent (connecting on port 50000).
Executes pipeline stages (build, test, deploy) inside Docker.
```
## 3. Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

```
AWS Account: An AWS account with rights to create EC2 instances and security groups.
Key Pair: An AWS EC2 Key Pair for SSH access to the instances (you can create one in the AWS
console if not already available).
```
#### • • • • • • • 1


```
EC2 Instances: Two EC2 virtual machines (VMs) running Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (64-bit). Use the
t3.micro instance type (which is sufficient for Jenkins in a test setup and is free-tier eligible). For
clarity, name one instance "jenkins-master" and the other "jenkins-agent". (Ensure at least 10 GB
of disk, and 1 GB RAM is a bare minimum for Jenkins, though more is recommended.)
Security Group Settings: Configure AWS security group rules to allow required network traffic:
SSH (Port 22) for remote access to both instances.
Jenkins Web (Port 8080) open to your network (or public internet, if webhooks are coming from
GitHub) for the Jenkins Master.
Jenkins Agent (Port 50000) open between the Master and Agent instances for JNLP agent
communication. (You can restrict this port to the private IP of the other instance for security.)
Application Port (8081) on the agent instance, if the application under test needs to be
reachable (e.g., for a web UI or external testing). This can be open to the master or your network
as needed.
Ensure outbound internet access is allowed (for package installation, plugin downloads, and
for Jenkins to reach GitHub/DockerHub).
Software and Accounts:
GitHub Repository: Access to the GitHub repo containing the Domain Monitoring System code
and Jenkinsfile (in this case: https://github.com/MatanItzhaki12/
domain_monitoring_devops.git).
GitHub Account: A GitHub account with permissions to set webhooks on the repository.
DockerHub Account: (Optional) If the pipeline will push Docker images to DockerHub, have an
account ready and credentials that can be used in Jenkins.
Jenkins CLI Tools: Not required. We will do everything via the web UI and CLI on the servers.
Local Machine Tools: SSH client to connect to the EC2 instances, and a text editor to edit files if
needed.
```
Ensure you have these prerequisites sorted out before proceeding. Next, we will launch and configure
the Jenkins Master server.

## 4. Jenkins Master Node Setup

### 4.1 Launch EC2 Instance for Jenkins Master

```
Launch Instance: Log in to the AWS Management Console, go to the EC2 dashboard, and click
"Launch Instance". In the launch wizard:
Name and OS: Enter a name (e.g., "jenkins-master"). Under Application and OS Images (AMI) ,
select an Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS AMI (64-bit).
Instance Type: Choose t3.micro (or equivalent) as the instance type.
Key Pair: Select an existing Key Pair or create a new one for SSH access. Ensure you have the
.pem file downloaded if new.
Network Settings: Choose the VPC and subnet. Attach or create a Security Group :
Allow SSH (TCP 22) from your IP (or a restricted range) so you can connect.
Allow HTTP (TCP 8080) from the internet or your IP (this will be used for Jenkins Web UI
and receiving GitHub webhooks).
Allow TCP 50000 from the Jenkins Agent instance (you can specify the agent's security
group or IP as the source) for JNLP agent communications.
(Optional) You can open TCP 8081 here as well if planning to use it for the application test
access (not needed on master, typically on agent).
Storage: Allocate storage (the default 8-10 GB is usually fine for Jenkins, but consider 20+ GB if
you'll have many builds).
Launch: Review and launch the instance. Wait until its state is "running".

_Note:_ For simplicity in testing, you might temporarily allow 0.0.0.0/0 on ports 8080/50000 (open to all).
**However, this is not secure for production** – restrict these to specific IPs or ranges. For the webhook
to reach Jenkins, port 8080 needs to be accessible from the public internet (GitHub's servers).

```
Obtain Connection Info: After launch, note the Public IPv4 address or Public DNS of the
instance (for web access and SSH). Also note the Private IP (e.g., 172.31.x.x) – this will be used by
the Jenkins agent to communicate with the master internally.
```
### 4.2 Connect to the Master via SSH and Install Docker

```
SSH into Instance: Open a terminal on your local machine and connect to the new EC2 instance
using SSH. For example:
```
```
ssh-i /path/to/your-key.pemubuntu@<Master_Public_IP>
```
Replace <Master_Public_IP> with the actual public IP or DNS. The default username for Ubuntu
AMIs is " **ubuntu** ". Ensure your .pem key file has restrictive permissions (chmod 400) so SSH will
accept it. You should now have a shell on the EC2 instance.

```
Update System Packages: Once connected, update apt packages to get the latest listings:
```
```
sudoaptupdate
```
```
Install Docker: Install Docker Engine and other helpful tools:
```
```
sudoaptinstall -y docker.iogit
```
This installs Docker (from Ubuntu's repositories) and Git. We include Git in case you need it for
troubleshooting or if Jenkins needs it (Jenkins will also have its own Git plugin). The Ubuntu
docker.io package provides the Docker daemon and CLI.

```
Install Docker Compose (Optional): If you need Docker Compose, you can install it as well (not
strictly required for Jenkins itself). For Ubuntu 24.04, you might install Compose V2 plugin:
```
```
sudoaptinstall -y docker-compose
```
(This step is optional, as our Jenkins pipeline will not directly use docker-compose unless your
Jenkinsfile does so.)

```
Post-Install Docker Steps: Start the Docker service and enable it to run on startup:
```
```
sudosystemctlenable docker
sudosystemctlstartdocker
```
#### 1.

The enable ensures Docker daemon starts on boot, and start launches it now (Ubuntu typically
starts it upon install, but this ensures it's running). Verify Docker is active with sudo systemctl
status docker (it should show "active (running)").

```
Docker Without Sudo (Optional): By default, you need sudo to run Docker commands. To
allow the ubuntu user to run Docker without sudo (for convenience):
```
```
sudousermod-aG dockerubuntu
```
This adds the **ubuntu** user to the **docker** group. You have to log out and log back in (or use newgrp
docker) to apply this change. This step is optional for Jenkins usage because we will be running
Docker containers via sudo or system services. However, it’s useful for manual Docker commands and
maintenance.

_Gotcha:_ If you skip this, remember to use sudo for all Docker commands on the command line. Jenkins
in our setup will be running inside a container and won't be affected by the host user’s group.

### 4.3 Run Jenkins Master in Docker

Now we will run Jenkins on the master instance using Docker. Instead of installing Jenkins via apt or war,
the official **jenkins/jenkins** Docker image will be used, which includes Jenkins and runs it on port 8080.

```
Create Jenkins Volume: It's good practice to use a Docker volume for Jenkins home directory to
persist data. We can create a named volume (Docker will create it on the fly in the run command
as well). Let's do it explicitly:
```
```
sudodocker volumecreate jenkins_home
```
This volume will store Jenkins configuration and job data so that it isn’t lost if the container restarts or is
recreated.

```
Run Jenkins Container: Launch the Jenkins master container using the official LTS image:
```
```
sudodocker run-d --namejenkins-master\
-p 8080:8080 -p 50000:50000 \
-v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home\
--restart=unless-stopped \
jenkins/jenkins:lts
```
```
Breakdown of this command: - -d runs the container in detached mode (in the background). -
--name jenkins-master names the container for easy reference. - -p 8080:8080 maps
container port 8080 to host 8080 (Jenkins web UI). - -p 50000:50000 maps container port
50000 to host 50000 (JNLP agent port). - -v jenkins_home:/var/jenkins_home attaches
the volume we created to Jenkins home directory in the container, so Jenkins data persists. - --
restart=unless-stopped configures Docker to auto-restart this container if it crashes or if
the Docker service restarts (e.g., on reboot). - jenkins/jenkins:lts specifies the Jenkins
Docker image (Long-Term Support version).
```
```

```

#### 1.

#### 1.


```
This command will download the Jenkins image (if not already present) and start the Jenkins
service inside the container. It may take a minute on first run to download the image.
```
```
Verify Container Status: After a few seconds, check that the container is running:
```
```
sudodocker ps -l
```
```
You should see jenkins/jenkins:lts in the list with STATUS "Up ...". If it’s not running
(docker ps shows it exited), use sudo docker logs jenkins-master to see errors.
Common issues might be port conflicts (ensure nothing else is on 8080/50000) or insufficient
memory (t3.micro should handle Jenkins, but it’s on the lower end; monitor usage if needed).
```
```
Allow Jenkins to Initialize: Jenkins will run an initial setup inside the container. It may take a
minute or two on first startup (it installs some default plugins). You can watch the log output:
```
```
sudodocker logs-f jenkins-master
```
```
Look for a line that says something like "Jenkins initial setup is required" or "Please use the
following password..." – this contains the initial admin password. You will need this for the next
step.
```
```
Once you see “Jenkins is fully up and running” in the logs, the Jenkins Master is ready.
```
### 4.4 Unlock and Configure Jenkins Master

With Jenkins running, we need to perform the initial web-based setup: unlocking Jenkins, installing
plugins, and creating an admin user.

```
Access Jenkins Web UI: In a web browser, navigate to http://<Master_Public_IP>:.
(If you’re using an AWS public DNS name, that works too, e.g., http://ec2-xx-xx-xx-
xx.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080). You should see the "Unlock Jenkins" screen. This
means Jenkins container is running and accessible.
```
```
Retrieve Initial Admin Password: Jenkins, on first run, generates a random initial administrator
password. We need to obtain it from the container. In your SSH session on the master instance,
run:
```
```
sudodocker execjenkins-mastercat/var/jenkins_home/secrets/
initialAdminPassword
```
```
This will output a 32-character alphanumeric password to the console. Copy this value.
```
```
Unlock Jenkins: In the browser, paste the copied password into the "Administrator password"
field and click "Continue". If the password is correct, you’ll proceed to the next setup screen.
```
```
Install Plugins: Jenkins will ask you to "Customize Jenkins". Choose "Install suggested
plugins". Jenkins will then automatically download and install a set of recommended plugins.
```
#### 2.

#### 3.

#### 1.

#### 2.

#### 3.

#### 4.


```
These typically include: Git, GitHub, Pipeline, Docker Pipeline, Credentials, etc., which are useful
for our CI/CD pipeline. This process may take a few minutes. You’ll see a progress screen as
plugins install. (Ensure the instance has internet access for this; if behind a proxy, additional
config is needed, but on AWS with default settings it should be fine.)
```
```
Note: If you prefer a custom set of plugins, you can choose the option to select plugins and
include Git , Pipeline , Docker Pipeline , GitHub , SSH Agent , JUnit , etc. But "suggested" covers
most of these. You can always install more plugins later via Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins.
```
```
Create Admin User: After plugins install, Jenkins will prompt to create your first admin user. Fill
in a username, password, full name, and email for the admin. (For example, user: admin, pass:
a strong password). This will create a new admin user and disable the default built-in admin
(which was using that initial password). If you prefer, you can skip creating a user and continue
using the admin user with the initial password, but that's not recommended for real setups.
Click "Save and Finish".
```
```
Confirm Jenkins is Ready: You should see a "Jenkins is ready" message and a "Start using
Jenkins" button. Click it to go to the Jenkins Dashboard. Now you have a running Jenkins master,
accessible at http://<Master_IP>:8080, with an admin account.
```
```
Configure Global Settings (Optional): This is a good time to check a couple of Jenkins settings:
```
```
Navigate to Manage Jenkins > Configure System. Set the Jenkins URL to http://
<Master_Public_IP>:8080 (or a domain if you have one) and save. This ensures
Jenkins uses the correct URL in things like webhook configuration and links.
Under Manage Jenkins > Manage Nodes , you will see the master node (often named
"Built-In Node" or "Master"). By default, the master is set to handle build executors.
However, since we will use a separate agent, you can reduce the master’s # of executors
to 0 to avoid running builds on the master (recommended for security and to dedicate
resources to the agent). To do this, click the master node, choose Configure , set "Number
of executors" to 0, and save. (This step is optional but aligns with best practice to use
agents for builds.)
```
At this point, the Jenkins Master is fully set up. Next, we will set up the Jenkins Agent node.

## 5. Jenkins Agent Node Setup

The Jenkins Agent node will run builds and tests. We will launch the second EC2, install Docker (and
Java), and connect it to the master.

### 5.1 Launch EC2 Instance for Jenkins Agent

```
Launch Second Instance: In AWS EC2 console, launch another instance for the Jenkins Agent:
Use Ubuntu 24.04 LTS (same AMI type) and t3.micro instance type.
Name it "jenkins-agent" for clarity.
In the Security Group settings, you can use the same security group as the master if it was
configured to allow needed ports, or create a new one. The key requirements:
Allow SSH (22) from your IP (to manage the agent server).
Ensure this agent can communicate with the master on port 50000. If using the same
security group, you could have an inbound rule on the master allowing port 50000 from
```
#### 5.

#### 6.

#### 7.

#### 4.

#### ◦

#### ◦


```
the security group itself (intra-security-group traffic). Otherwise, allow port 50000
inbound on master from the agent’s IP or subnet.
Allow 8081 inbound on the agent if the application under test will be accessed externally
(for example, if you want to view the test application’s UI in a browser or allow Selenium
on another machine to reach it). This can be optional – if tests run entirely within the
agent, you might not need 8081 open to the world.
(Opening 8080 on the agent is not necessary for Jenkins, since the agent doesn’t run a
web UI; any 8080 use on agent would be for the app itself if at all.)
```
```
Use the same Key Pair for SSH, or a new one. Launch the instance and wait for it to start.
```
```
SSH into Agent: Just like with the master, SSH into the agent instance:
```
```
ssh-i /path/to/your-key.pemubuntu@<Agent_Public_IP>
```
Use the agent instance’s public IP/DNS. You should get a shell on the agent VM.

### 5.2 Install Docker and Java on Agent

```
Update and Install Packages: On the agent EC2, update apt and install Docker, Java, and Git:
```
```
sudoaptupdate
sudoaptinstall -y docker.ioopenjdk-11-jre-headlessgit
```
```
Docker: This installs Docker engine on the agent (so the agent can run Docker containers for
builds/tests).
Java: Jenkins agents require Java to run the agent program. We're installing OpenJDK 11 JRE
headless which is sufficient for the Jenkins agent process. (Jenkins inbound agent is basically a
Java program that connects to the master.)
```
```
Git: Installing Git (for completeness, if the agent needs to run any git commands or if you want
to use it manually; the Jenkins pipeline will usually handle SCM checkout via the master’s
plugins).
```
```
Add ubuntu to docker group (Optional):
```
```
sudousermod-aG dockerubuntu
```
Similar to master, this is for convenience. Since we'll likely run the agent container with sudo or as a
system service, it's not strictly necessary, but it can help if you run Docker commands manually on the
agent.

```
Start Docker and Enable on Boot:
```
```
sudosystemctlenable docker
sudosystemctlstartdocker
```

Ensure Docker daemon is running on the agent as well. The agent will be running a Docker container
for the Jenkins agent process, and also using Docker to run builds, so the Docker service must be active.

```
Verify Java: Check that Java is installed by running java -version. You should see an
OpenJDK version (11.x). This confirms the agent can run Java programs (the Jenkins agent will
run as a Java process inside a container or directly, but having Java on host is a good backup and
is needed if we run the agent as a jar outside of Docker).
```
_At this stage, the agent machine has Docker and Java set up – ready to run the Jenkins agent._

### 5.3 Register Agent Node in Jenkins Master

Before we run the agent, we must inform the Jenkins master about this new agent and obtain the secret
for connection. We’ll do this via Jenkins’s web interface:

```
Create Node in Jenkins UI: On the Jenkins master web UI, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage
Nodes and Clouds (or it might just say "Manage Nodes"). Click "New Node". In the dialog:
Enter a node name, e.g., "agent1" (or any identifier you like).
Select Permanent Agent (not a cloud or ephemeral).
```
```
Click OK to proceed to node configuration.
```
```
Configure Agent Node:
```
```
Remote root directory: set this to a path where the agent’s workspace will live inside the agent
container. A common value is /home/jenkins or /var/jenkins (the container's default
working directory for the Jenkins user). For simplicity, use /home/jenkins/agent or /home/
jenkins – we will ensure the container uses the same.
Labels: (Optional) add a label like docker or agent or linux. If your Jenkinsfile uses a
node label (e.g., agent { label 'docker' }), put that here. Otherwise, you can leave it
blank or put a generic label.
# of executors: leave it as 1 (meaning this agent can run one build at a time, which is fine for a
t3.micro).
Launch method: This is crucial. Choose "Launch agent by connecting it to the controller"
(formerly called "JNLP" or inbound launch). This means we will start the agent manually, and it
will initiate the connection to Jenkins (as opposed to Jenkins trying to SSH into the agent, which
we are not using here).
You can leave other settings (work directory, environment variables) default for now.
```
Click **Save**. Jenkins will add the node. Initially, it will show as **offline** (which is expected, since we haven’t
started the agent process yet).

```
Obtain Agent Secret: After saving, Jenkins will show an agent page. Since we chose "launch by
connecting it", Jenkins provides a secret key for the agent and instructions. On the node’s page,
look for something like:
```
```
A command line snippet and the secret. It might say: "Use the following command to connect this
agent:" and show a command with -secret <long_hex_value> -jnlpUrl http://
<master>:8080/computer/agent1/jenkins-agent.jnlp etc. The key part is the
<secret> (a long alphanumeric string). Copy this secret value.
```
#### 1.

#### 1.

#### 2.

#### 3.

#### 4.

#### 5.

#### 6.

#### 7.

#### 8.

#### 9.

#### 10.

#### 1.

#### 2.


```
If it doesn’t show a full command, you will definitely see the secret listed on this page (or click
"Secret" or "Agent.jar" link). Copy the secret to a safe place temporarily. Also note the agent
name you used (e.g., agent1).
```
_We will use this secret to authenticate the agent when it connects to the master._ (Jenkins uses this secret to
ensure an agent is allowed to connect as that node.)

### 5.4 Start Jenkins Agent as a Docker Container

Now we have the agent node defined and a secret. We’ll run the Jenkins agent on the agent EC
instance inside a Docker container.

```
On the agent EC2, run the Jenkins inbound agent container:
```
```
We will use the official Jenkins inbound agent image (jenkins/inbound-agent). This image
contains the Jenkins agent software (Remoting library) and will connect to the master. Run the
following on the agent VM :
```
```
sudodocker run-d --namejenkins-agent --init -u root\
-v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock\
--restart=unless-stopped \
jenkins/inbound-agent:latest\
-urlhttp://<Master_Private_IP>:8080\
<agent-secret><agent1>
```
```
Replace: - <Master_Private_IP> with the private IP address of the master instance (e.g.,
http://172.31.x.x:8080). We use the private IP because the agent and master are within
the same AWS network, and the security group allows port 50000 internally. (If for some reason
the agent cannot reach the master’s private IP, you could use the public IP, but then ensure port 50000
is open to the agent’s public IP.) - <agent-secret> with the secret key you copied from Jenkins. -
<agent1> with the agent node name you configured (it must exactly match the name in
Jenkins). For example, if your node is "agent1", put agent1 here.
```
```
Let's break down this command: - jenkins/inbound-agent:latest is the Docker image for
Jenkins agent. (It’s effectively a Java program that will connect to the master). - We pass -url
http://<master>:8080 to tell the agent where the Jenkins controller is. - Then we provide the
<secret> and <agent name> as arguments as required by the image entrypoint. - We
include --init which runs an init process inside the container. This is recommended for
proper signal handling and to avoid zombie processes when the agent runs builds. - We run as
-u root. This ensures the container’s process runs as root user. We do this because we will
mount the Docker socket and need permissions to run Docker inside, and also to easily install
Docker CLI inside the container. (The image’s default user might be jenkins which may not
have permission on /var/run/docker.sock.) - We mount the host’s Docker socket into the
container: -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock. This is critical : it allows
the agent (inside container) to use the host machine’s Docker daemon. That way, any Docker
commands executed by Jenkins on the agent will actually run on the agent host (enabling the
agent to build images or run containers as needed). - We set --restart=unless-stopped so
this agent container will restart automatically on reboot or if it crashes.
```
#### 3.

#### 1.


```
After running this, Docker will start the agent container. You can verify with sudo docker ps
that jenkins/inbound-agent:latest is running.
```
```
Check Jenkins Agent Connection: Go to the Jenkins web UI, Manage Jenkins > Manage
Nodes. The agent node you created ("agent1") should now show a green indicator or
"Connected" and "Online". In the agent’s status page, you might see some system info appear,
and it should say "agent1 is online".
```
```
If it still shows offline after a minute: - Check the logs of the agent container: sudo docker
logs -f jenkins-agent on the agent VM. Look for errors such as inability to resolve the
master hostname or authentication issues. Common fixes: - If it says "unknown host" or
"connection refused", ensure the URL is correct and reachable. For private IP, the agent’s VPC
DNS must resolve the master’s IP or you can just use the IP numbers. - If it says "Unauthorized"
or bad secret, double-check the secret and agent name. - If networking is an issue, you can try
using the master’s public DNS in the URL instead (with proper security group open). - Verify the
master is listening on port 50000. (Jenkins Docker image by default exposes it. In Jenkins UI,
under Configure Global Security , the "TCP port for inbound agents" is by default 50000 – it
should be enabled by our Docker run which mapped that port.)
```
```
Once connected, the master’s UI should list the agent with some details (like number of
executors, etc.). Great – we have an operational Jenkins agent!
```
```
Install Docker CLI inside Agent Container: This is a crucial step for CI with Docker. The Jenkins
agent container we launched includes Java (to run the agent) but it does not include the Docker
CLI by default. Our pipeline will likely use Docker commands (like docker build, docker
run , etc.) on the agent. Since we mounted the Docker socket, any Docker CLI call inside the
agent container will control Docker on the host. But if the docker command is not present
inside the container, those steps will fail.
```
```
To install Docker CLI in the running agent container, execute:
```
```
sudodocker exec-u rootjenkins-agentapt-get update
sudodocker exec-u rootjenkins-agentapt-get install-y docker.io
```
```
What this does: - docker exec runs a command inside an existing container. We run as root
user (we started the container as root, but we include -u root to be explicit). - We update
package lists and install the docker.io package inside the container. The
jenkins/inbound-agent image is based on a Linux distribution that supports apt (currently
it’s a Debian-based image), so this installs the Docker CLI within the container.
```
```
After this, you can test by running: sudo docker exec jenkins-agent docker version.
It should execute the Docker CLI inside the container and output version info, indicating the
container can invoke Docker on the host.
```
```
Alternative: Instead of this manual install, one could use a custom agent Docker image that
already has Docker installed (or use the official jenkins/inbound-agent as a base and
Dockerfile to add Docker CLI). But the above approach is a quick solution.
```
#### 2.

#### 3.


```
Persistence & Auto-start Considerations: We already set --restart=unless-stopped on
the agent container, so it will try to come back after reboots. However, note that if Jenkins master
is not up when the agent starts, it will continuously retry to connect (which is fine). The agent
container will run as a background service on the agent VM. There’s no further action needed,
but for completeness:
```
```
The agent’s work directories (Jenkins workspace, etc.) are inside the container (by
default under /home/jenkins or /agent depending on image). If you want to persist
workspace or cache, you could mount a volume for /home/jenkins too. This is
optional; builds typically can be ephemeral.
We installed Docker CLI inside the container; that layer will disappear if the container is
removed. If you ever recreate the agent container, remember to reinstall Docker CLI or
build it into the image.
We have effectively “wrapped” the JNLP agent in a system service via Docker. If you prefer
a more traditional approach, you could run the agent as a systemd service running
java -jar agent.jar ... on the host. The provided design mentioned using a
.service file for the agent, but since we use Docker’s restart mechanism, we do not
necessarily need an external service file for the agent container.
```
At this point, we have Jenkins master and agent up and connected. Now we will configure a Jenkins
pipeline job and the GitHub webhook to trigger it.

## 6. Jenkins Pipeline Job Configuration

With the infrastructure in place, let's set up the actual CI/CD pipeline job in Jenkins and integrate it with
GitHub.

### 6.1 Create a Pipeline Job in Jenkins

```
Create New Pipeline Job: On the Jenkins dashboard (master UI), click "New Item". Enter an
item name, for example "DomainMonitoring_CI_Pipeline". Select "Pipeline" as the project type
(since our Jenkinsfile defines a pipeline) and click OK.
```
```
General Settings (optional): In the new job configuration page, you can add a description like
"Pipeline for Domain Monitoring System CI/CD". If your Jenkins has the GitHub plugin installed (it
should, from suggested plugins), you’ll see a "GitHub project" checkbox. You can check it and
paste the GitHub repository URL (https://github.com/MatanItzhaki12/
domain_monitoring_devops.git) for reference. This isn't strictly necessary but provides a
direct link to the repo from Jenkins.
```
```
Source Code Management: Under Pipeline settings (scroll down), find the Pipeline script from
SCM option:
```
```
Choose SCM: Git.
Repository URL: put the GitHub repo URL (https://github.com/MatanItzhaki12/
domain_monitoring_devops.git). Jenkins will attempt to fetch this. If the repo is public, no
credentials are needed. If private, you'd add credentials in Jenkins and select them here.
(If Jenkins complains about Git not being available, ensure the Git plugin is installed. The
suggested plugins usually include it. Alternatively, Jenkins can use JGit internally. Our earlier

```
installation of Git on the OS was more for convenience, as the Jenkins container has its own
environment.)
Branch Specifier: you can leave as */master or */main depending on the repo’s main
branch. Let's assume the main branch is main (adjust if needed). You can put */main or the
specific branch name.
Script Path: this is the path to the Jenkinsfile in the repository. If the Jenkinsfile is at the root of
the repo and named "Jenkinsfile", leave it as Jenkinsfile (default). If it’s in a subfolder,
specify the path (e.g., ci/Jenkinsfile).
```
This configuration tells Jenkins to pull the Jenkinsfile from your GitHub repo, so our pipeline logic is
source-controlled.

```
Build Triggers: To have Jenkins respond to GitHub pushes, scroll to Build Triggers section:
Check the box "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling". This enables Jenkins to be triggered
by the GitHub webhook. (Under the hood, the GitHub plugin will listen for the webhook call and
then schedule a build without needing to poll.)
You do not need to enable polling (the webhook replaces it), and you don't need other triggers
for now.
```
_Note:_ Ensure that in **Manage Jenkins > Manage Plugins** , the "GitHub Plugin" (for webhooks) is
installed, and in **Manage Jenkins > Configure System** , a GitHub server may be added. The default
configuration usually works for public repos via webhooks. If the webhook doesn't trigger builds, you
might need to configure a GitHub API token in Jenkins and add GitHub under Configure System – but
often just the plugin and the checkbox is enough for basic push events.

```
Save the Job: Click Save at the bottom of the job configuration. You should now see the pipeline
job created on the dashboard.
```
At this point, Jenkins knows about the repo and is ready to run the pipeline defined in the Jenkinsfile.
Next, we'll set up the GitHub webhook so pushes to the repo notify Jenkins.

### 6.2 Configure GitHub Webhook

```
Set up Webhook in GitHub Repo: Go to the GitHub repository page (https://github.com/
MatanItzhaki12/domain_monitoring_devops.git) in your browser. You’ll need admin access to the
repo to add a webhook.
Click on "Settings" (the Settings tab of the repository).
In the left sidebar, choose "Webhooks" , then click "Add webhook".
Payload URL: This should point to your Jenkins master’s webhook endpoint. Format: http://
<Master_Public_IP>:8080/github-webhook/. (Make sure to use the correct protocol
(http or https if you set up SSL). For our setup, it's http. If you had a custom domain or
DNS, you could use that. Ensure there's a trailing slash and "github-webhook" exactly, as this is
the endpoint Jenkins GitHub plugin listens on.)
Content type: Select application/json (GitHub will send JSON payloads).
Secret: (Optional) You can leave this blank for simplicity. If you fill it, you’d have to configure the
same secret in Jenkins’ GitHub plugin settings. For now, blank means no signature verification.
Which events: Choose "Just push events". This will trigger on pushes to any branch (you can
further restrict in webhook settings if needed, but generally push is fine).
Click "Add webhook" to save. GitHub will immediately try to send a ping event to the URL.
```
```
After adding, you should see the new webhook in the list. A green check mark or "Last delivery
was successful" indicates Jenkins responded (or at least returned HTTP 200). If you see a red X,
```

```
click the webhook to see the delivery details. Jenkins might not respond to the test ping with
content, but as long as it's a 200 OK, GitHub will mark it green.
```
```
Verify Jenkins Received Webhook: In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > System Log (or look at
the logs via docker logs on the master). You might see an entry that a payload was received.
Another way: in the GitHub webhook configuration page, there is a Recent Deliveries section.
Select the latest delivery (the ping or a test push) and check the response. It should show a
response code 200 if Jenkins endpoint received it.
```
Jenkins is now set to trigger the pipeline whenever a push happens on the repository.

_Tip:_ If you want Jenkins to automatically manage webhooks (instead of creating manually), you could
configure the GitHub integration with an API token and set **Manage Hooks** to let Jenkins create them.
But manual setup as we did is straightforward for a single pipeline.

### 6.3 Initial Pipeline Run and Testing

```
Run a Test Build: Back in Jenkins, open the pipeline job we created. Since this is the first run, it’s
often good to run it manually to ensure everything is in place (and in some cases Jenkins
registers the webhook after first run). Click "Build Now" for the pipeline job. This should queue
a build and start it within a few seconds.
The build will likely go to the agent (if your Jenkinsfile has agent any or a specific label,
Jenkins will use the appropriate node). Because we set master executors to 0, it should choose
the agent.
Click the build in the build history to see the console output. Jenkins will: check out the repository
(you should see "Checking out Git ..."), then proceed through the stages defined in the Jenkinsfile
(e.g., build Docker image, run tests, etc.). This confirms that Jenkins can fetch the code and that
the agent is functioning.
If the build fails at checkout stage with an authentication issue, the repo might be private – you'll
need to add credentials in Jenkins for Git. If it fails later, debug according to the error (maybe
Docker commands, etc., see Troubleshooting below).
```
```
If the build passes, great. If it fails due to tests (which could happen if something in the app or
tests is not correct), that’s application-specific – Jenkins is set up correctly if it at least ran the
stages.
```
```
Trigger via Git Push: Now test the webhook trigger. Make a trivial commit to the GitHub repo
(e.g., edit README or a minor change in code) and push it to the repository’s main branch.
Within a few seconds of pushing, Jenkins should detect the webhook and queue a new build
automatically (you’ll see it on the Jenkins dashboard with an incremented build number). This
confirms the end-to-end automation: GitHub -> Jenkins webhook -> Jenkins agent runs the
pipeline.
```
```
Monitor and Review: Watch the pipeline run on Jenkins. The console output will show each step.
For the Domain Monitoring System project, you should see steps corresponding to those
outlined in the design:
```
```
Docker image build (temporary image tagging perhaps with commit ID).
Spinning up a container of the app.
Running the pytest and selenium test suite.

```
If tests pass, tagging and pushing a new Docker image to DockerHub (make sure to
configure DockerHub credentials if this part is in the Jenkinsfile).
Cleaning up containers/images.
The Jenkins console will mark the build SUCCESS or FAILURE accordingly.
```
```
All network and file configurations we set up (ports open, Docker available, volumes) should
facilitate these steps. For example, the agent’s Docker can pull base images and push to
DockerHub (it has internet access), the test container can reach any external services if needed,
etc.
```
## 7. Network and Firewall Considerations

```
Security Group Recap: The master node’s security group should allow inbound 8080 (web UI)
from wherever you need (your IP for UI, and GitHub’s servers for webhook). GitHub’s webhook IP
ranges are broad, so often 0.0.0.0/0 on 8080 is used for simplicity. In a tighter security setup, you
might front Jenkins with a proxy or limit by source IP (GitHub publishes a list of hook IPs). The
agent’s security group should allow inbound from the master on 50000 (or both could be in
same SG with a rule to allow SG-to-SG traffic on 50000). We also opened 8081 on the agent for
potential external access to the test application (if not needed, you can omit that). Always lock
down SSH (port 22) to your IP or use AWS Session Manager for access.
Internal Traffic: The master and agent communicate over port 50000. We used the master's
private IP in the agent configuration, avoiding exposing 50000 publicly. As long as the security
groups and VPC settings allow it, this is more secure and faster. The agent container will
continuously try to reconnect if it loses connection. This is normal, just ensure it can reach the
master.
Firewall (Ubuntu UFW): Ubuntu by default has UFW off on AWS instances. If you enable it,
remember to ufw allow 22,8080,50000,8081 as needed. Otherwise, the AWS security
group is your firewall.
DNS and IPs: Using IP addresses in webhook and agent config is fine if they are static or long-
lived. Note AWS EC2 public IPs can change on stop/start (unless using Elastic IP). You might
consider using an Elastic IP for the Jenkins master so the webhook URL doesn’t break. Or update
the webhook if IP changes. Alternatively, use a domain name (and maybe a dynamic DNS) for
convenience.
HTTPS for Jenkins: This SOP didn’t cover securing Jenkins with SSL. For production, consider
putting Jenkins behind an HTTPS reverse proxy or using Amazon’s ALB with SSL. At minimum, set
up credentials and matrix security if multiple users.
Jenkins Master Persistence: All Jenkins data (jobs, config, plugins) is on the jenkins_home
Docker volume. It's good to routinely back this up (you can snapshot the volume or copy data
out). If the container or instance is lost, you can re-launch Jenkins with that volume to restore
state.
```
## 8. Additional Configuration and Troubleshooting

```
DockerHub Credentials: If the pipeline pushes Docker images to DockerHub (as indicated by
the project, pushing matanitzhaki/domain-monitoring images), you need to provide
credentials. In Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins > Manage Credentials (or directly in the pipeline
job config under credentials). Add your DockerHub username/password (or token) as a
credential. In the Jenkinsfile, ensure docker login is performed (or use withCredentials). The
example pipeline likely expects certain credentials IDs or environment variables (like
DOCKERHUB_USER and DOCKERHUB_PASS). Set those up in Jenkins (either in credentials or as
global env vars in the node config).
```

```
Email/Notifications: If you want Jenkins to send emails on failures, configure an SMTP server in
Manage Jenkins > Configure System > E-mail Notification and use the Email Extension Plugin
in the pipeline.
Agent Offline Issues: If the agent goes offline frequently:
Ensure the agent container is running (docker ps on agent). Docker’s restart policy should
keep it running.
Check for network connectivity issues between agent and master (security group changes, etc.).
Ensure the master’s TCP inbound port is set to 50000 (default) and not changed after restart.
You can also enable the Work Dir for the agent: for durability, run agent with
-workDir=/home/jenkins/agent and mount a volume. This can help if the connection
drops; the agent can store state. (This was mentioned in the Jenkins documentation as an
option).
Resource Considerations: t3.micro is small (1 vCPU, ~1GB RAM). Running Jenkins and Docker
builds/tests on these might be slow. The master on t3.micro is usually fine for light use. The
agent running tests (especially with Selenium, maybe launching a browser headless, etc.) could
be constrained. Monitor CPU/RAM usage. If needed, consider t3.small or larger for the agent to
speed up tests. You can also use swap on AWS or adjust test parallelism.
Selenium Tests: If the pipeline includes Selenium UI tests, ensure the environment can support
it. Often, projects use a headless browser (Chrome/Firefox headless). Make sure the Docker
image used for tests has the necessary drivers and maybe a virtual display if not headless. If
tests fail due to browser issues, you might need to tweak the Dockerfile or Jenkinsfile (this is
outside the SOP’s main scope, but worth noting).
Pipeline Debugging: You can always test parts of the pipeline by logging into the agent and
manually running the Docker build or test commands to see what’s wrong. The Jenkins
workspace on the agent (inside the container) can be found under the container’s file system (for
example, /home/jenkins/workspace/<job_name>). If a build fails, Jenkins usually prints the
error and stacktrace. Use that to pinpoint issues (e.g., test assertion failed, or Docker build
failed).
Jenkins Logs and Restart: The master Jenkins logs are viewable via docker logs jenkins-
master. If Jenkins becomes unresponsive (e.g., high load or memory), you can restart the
container: docker restart jenkins-master. It will reapply the --restart policy (so it
will come back up). Agents will reconnect automatically. Frequent restarts might indicate the
instance is underpowered.
```
## 9. Summary

You have now set up a robust Jenkins CI/CD environment on AWS: - A Jenkins Master in a Docker
container on Ubuntu (with persistent storage for config and an admin user configured). - A Jenkins
Agent in a Docker container on a second Ubuntu instance (with Docker installed to handle build
workloads). - Both instances properly networked (ports 8080, 50000, etc.) and secured via AWS Security
Groups. - A Pipeline job that pulls code from GitHub and runs a test/build/deploy pipeline defined in a
Jenkinsfile, with triggers in place for automatic builds on git push. - Docker is leveraged for Jenkins
itself and for the build steps, ensuring environment consistency and isolation.

This SOP is designed to be foolproof: following the numbered steps will set up the system from scratch.
By adhering to it, even users with minimal background can deploy an industry-standard CI/CD pipeline.
Always remember to monitor your CI system and keep Jenkins and plugins up to date (especially for
security patches). Good luck with your Jenkins pipeline and happy DevOps!
